use clap::Subcommand;
use std::process::ExitCode;

/// A trait representing a shell or command-line interface that executes
/// the main program logic and returns an `ExitCode` to indicate the
/// outcome of its execution.
///
/// This trait is designed to provide a standardized structure for
/// implementing shells or program interfaces that handle the main execution
/// logic and communicate success or failure outcomes consistently.
///
/// # Required Methods
///
/// The `Shell` trait requires the implementation of the following method:
///
/// ## `run`
///
/// Executes the core logic of the shell or program and returns an
/// `ExitCode` to signify the result of the execution.
///
/// ### Returns
///
/// The method returns an `ExitCode` enum to indicate the final outcome:
///
/// - `ExitCode::SUCCESS`: Indicates that the program executed successfully.
/// - `ExitCode::FAILURE`: Indicates that the program encountered errors during execution.
///
/// ### Usage Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::process::ExitCode;
///
/// struct MyShell;
///
/// impl Shell for MyShell {
///     fn run() -> ExitCode {
///         // Example implementation of program logic
///         println!("Running shell logic...");
///         ExitCode::SUCCESS
///     }
/// }
///
/// let result = MyShell::run();
/// assert_eq!(result, ExitCode::SUCCESS);
/// ```
///
/// By implementing this trait, you can create shells that encapsulate
/// their independent logic while ensuring consistent `ExitCode` handling.
pub trait Shell {
    /// Executes the main logic of the program and returns an `ExitCode` indicating the
    /// success or failure of the program's execution.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// * `ExitCode::SUCCESS` - If the program completes successfully.
    /// * `ExitCode::FAILURE` - If the program encounters an error during its execution.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// use std::process::ExitCode;
    ///
    /// fn run() -> ExitCode {
    ///     // Your logic here
    ///     ExitCode::SUCCESS
    /// }
    ///
    /// let result = run();
    /// assert_eq!(result, ExitCode::SUCCESS);
    /// ```

    /// This function serves as the entry point for program execution, handling
    /// the primary tasks and ensuring a proper exit status is returned.
    ///

/// Represents the various environments in which an application can operate.
///
/// This enumeration is typically used to differentiate application configurations,
/// behaviors, or logging strategies based on the deployment or runtime context.
///
/// # Variants
///
/// - `Production`
///   Represents the production environment, where the application is fully deployed
///   and accessible by end users. Typically optimized for stability and performance.
///
/// - `Development`
///   Represents the development environment, used during active development.
///   Debugging tools and verbose logging are often enabled in this context.
///
/// - `Test`
///   Represents the testing environment, used for running automated tests or manual
///   quality assurance checks. It may include mock objects or testing-specific configurations.
///
/// - `Staging`
///   Represents the staging environment, used to validate changes before deploying to
///   production. It is usually a replica or subset of the production environment.
///
/// - `Local`
///   Represents the local environment, typically run on a developer's machine during
///   the early stages of development or testing.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// use your_crate::Environment;
///
/// fn print_environment(env: Environment) {
///     match env {
///         Environment::Production => println!("Running in Production environment"),
///         Environment::Development => println!("Running in Development environment"),

///         Environment::Local => println!("Running in Local environment"),

    /// The `image_import` function allows you to import an image from a specified location.
    /// It performs the necessary initialization and checks required to handle the
    /// image operations in the program. This function may involve file validation
    /// and loading operations to prepare the image resources.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// * `ExitCode` - Returns an exit status code indicating the success or failure
    ///   of the image import operation.
    ///   - `ExitCode::Success` if the image is successfully imported.
    ///   - `ExitCode::Failure` if the image import fails or encounters an error.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    /// The function might fail for reasons including, but not limited to:
    /// * The file does not exist or cannot be located.
    /// * The file format is unsupported.
    /// * Issues with reading the file due to insufficient permissions or corrupted data.
    ///
    /// # Example
    /// ```rust
    /// use std::process::ExitCode;
    ///
    /// fn main() {
    ///     match image_import() {
